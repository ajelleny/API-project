**Unsolved problems/major hurdles:**
A major hurdle was understanding DOM manipulation. Throughout the project it was difficult for me to understand how to use DOM manipulation to add more features to my project, but towards the end of the project I had a better understanding of DOM manipulation. An unresolved problem I had, was not configuring the images to be a certain size so they wouldn't take over most of the page.
